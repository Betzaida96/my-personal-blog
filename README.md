My-Personal-Blog

I wanted to create a space where users could make posts to a blog. On the first page you see the title "My First Blog". Then you see where you as the user of the blog can enter a username, title for your blog post, and then content of your blog post. Then, there is a submit button that posts your blog post. If a field is left empty the user sees an error notifying them to fill out all fields.

Once sumbitted you are directed to a secondary page where you can see your blog post along with any other blog posts that have been submited. There is also a way for you to go back to the first page where you can make more posts!

Another fun feature of this blog is that you can change from light to dark mode, depending on the users preferance. If you decide to go back and forth between the pages your setting fo light or dark mode stays.

This project really helped me learn JavaScript. I learned a lot about the Local Storage of a web page. I learned how to make a website with multiple pages that interact with each other.

I would like to give credit to my tutor Meg Meyers who helped me set up the blog.js and form.js pages.

Here are some pictures of the deployed website.
